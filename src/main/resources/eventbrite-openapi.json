Check out [Intro to APIs](https://www.eventbrite.com/platform/docs/introduction) first to get up to speed. |\n| :---------------- | :---------------------------------- | :------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |\n\nThe Eventbrite API:\n\n* Is [REST](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/REST)-based (though we use POST instead of PUT).\n\n* Uses OAuth2 for authorization.\n\n* Always returns responses in [JSON](https://json.org/).\n\nAll URLs referenced in the API documentation have the following base: https://www.eventbriteapi.com/v3.\n\nFor the examples in this guide, we'll be using the [python-requests](https://github.com/kennethreitz/requests) library.\n\n## Authentication\n\n1. [Get a Private Token](#get-a-private-token)\n\n2. [(For App Partners) Authorize your Users](#authorize-your-users)\n\n3. [Authenticate API Requests](#authenticate-api-requests)\n\n<a name=\"get-a-private-token\"></a>\n\n### 1. Get a Private Token\n\na. Log in to your Eventbrite account and visit [your API Keys page](https://www.eventbrite.com/platform/api-keys).\n\nb. Copy your private token.\n\n<a name=\"authorize-your-users\"></a>\n\n### 2. (For App Partners) Authorize your Users\n\nNote: These steps enable you to perform API requests on behalf of other users. To perform API requests on your own behalf, skip to [Authenticate API Requests](#authenticate-api-requests).\n\n#### Authorize Users\n\nWhat You'll Need:\n\n* API Key\n\n* Client Secret\n\n* Redirect URI\n\nNote: To find this information, visit [your API Key Management page](https://www.eventbrite.com/account-settings/apps).\n\nThe Eventbrite API uses [OAuth 2.0](https://oauth.net/2/) for authorization.\n\nThere are two ways to authorize users: Server-side and client-side. We strongly recommend handling authorization on the server side for security reasons.\n\n* Server-Side Authorization (Recommended)\n\n    a. Redirect users to our authorization URL, while including your API key and redirect URI as query parameters:\n    `https://www.eventbrite.com/oauth/authorize?response_type=code&client_id=YOUR_API_KEY&redirect_uri=YOUR_REDIRECT_URI`\n\n    When the user authorizes your app, your redirect URI will receive a request from our authorization server with your access code included as a query parameter.\n\n    Here's an example of the URI you will be redirected to (with the access code included as a query parameter):\n    `http://localhost:8080/oauth/redirect?code=YOUR_ACCESS_CODE`\n\n    b. Send a POST request to `https://www.eventbrite.com/oauth/token` that specifies the grant type and includes your access code, client secret, and API key. This data should be sent as part of your request header.\n\n    Here's an example of a POST request using cURL:\n\n    ```\n    curl --request POST \\\n    --url 'https://www.eventbrite.com/oauth/token' \\\n    --header 'content-type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded' \\\n    --data grant_type=authorization_code \\\n    --data 'client_id=API_KEY \\\n    --data client_secret=CLIENT_SECRET \\\n    --data code=ACCESS_CODE \\\n    --data 'redirect_uri=REDIRECT_URI'\n    ```\n\n    The server will verify the access code and call your redirect URI. The user's private token will be available in the JSON response. Use this private token to make API requests on behalf of this user.\n\n* Client-Side Authorization\n\n    a. Redirect users to our authorization URL, while including your API key and redirect URI as query parameters:\n    `https://www.eventbrite.com/oauth/authorize?response_type=token&client_id=YOUR_API_KEY&redirect_uri=YOUR_REDIRECT_URI`\n\n    When the user authorizes your app, your redirect URI will receive a request with the private token included as a query parameter.\n\nNext up: Follow the steps in [Authenticate API Requests](#authenticate-api-requests).\n\n<a name=\"authenticate-api-requests\"></a>\n\n### 3. Authenticate API Requests\n\nTo authenticate API requests, you'll need to include either your private token or your user's private token.\n\nThere are two ways of including your token in an API request:\n\n* Authorization Header\n\n    Include the following in your Authorization header (replacing MYTOKEN with your token):\n\n    { Authorization: Bearer MYTOKEN }\n\n* Query Parameter Authentication\n\n    Include the following at the end of the URL (replacing MYTOKEN with your token):\n\n    /v3/users/me/?token=MYTOKEN\n\nFor every user you would like to perform API requests on behalf of, repeat [(For App Partners) Authorize your Users](#authorize-your-users) and [Authenticate API Requests](#authenticate-api-requests).\n<a name=\"best-practices\"></a>\n\n### Best practices\n\nThese best practices ensure that your authentication and access to the Eventbrite API is successful and secure.\n\n#### Do not use your private token directly in client-side code.\n\nBefore you make your application publicly available, ensure that your client-side code does not contain private tokens or any other private information.\n\n#### Delete unneeded API keys\n\nTo minimize your exposure to attack, delete any private tokens that you no longer need.\n\n## Errors\n\nWhen an error occurs during an API request, you will receive:\n\n* An HTTP error status (in the 400-500 range)\n\n* A JSON response containing more information about the error\n\nA typical error response looks like this:\n\n<pre><code>\n{\n    \"error\": \"VENUE_AND_ONLINE\",\n    \"error_description\": \"You cannot both specify a venue and set online_event\",\n    \"status_code\": 400\n}\n</code></pre>\n\nSee below for descriptions of what each line means:\n\n| Example                                                                      | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |\n| :--------------------------------------------------------------------------- | :------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |\n| {                                                                            |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |\n| \"error\": \"VENUE_AND_ONLINE\",                                                 | â€œVENUE_AND_ONLINEâ€ is an example of a constant string value for the error. This constant value is what you should base your error handling logic on, because this string wonâ€™t change depending on the locale or as the API changes over time.    |\n| \"error_description\": \"You cannot both specify a venue and set online_event\", | \"You cannot both specify a venue and set online_event\" is an example of an error description value. This string usually contains a description of the error, and should only be displayed to developers, not your users.                          |\n| \"status_code\": 400                                                           | 400 is an example of a status code value. This value mirrors the HTTP status code you will receive. Itâ€™s included for convenience, in case your HTTP client makes it difficult to get status codes, or has one error handler for all error codes. |\n|  }                                                                           |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |\n\n### Common Errors\n\nYou can find a listing of the individual errors for each endpoint on their endpoint entries, but there are also some common errors that all endpoints might return:\n\n| Status Code | Text                    | Description                                                                                                                                                          |\n| :---------- | :---------------------- | :------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |\n| 301         | PERMANENTLY_MOVED       | Resource must be retrieved from a different URL.                                                                                                                     |\n| 400         | ACTION_NOT_PROCESSED    | Requested operation not processed.                                                                                                                                   |\n| 400         | ARGUMENTS_ERROR         | There are errors with your arguments.                                                                                                                                |\n| 400         | BAD_CONTINUATION_TOKEN  | Invalid continuation token passed.                                                                                                                                   |\n| 400         | BAD_PAGE                | Page number does not exist or is an invalid format (e.g. negative).                                                                                                  |\n| 400         | BAD_REQUEST             | The resource youâ€™re creating already exists.                                                                                                                         |\n| 400         | INVALID_ARGUMENT        | Invalid argument value passed.                                                                                                                                       |\n| 400         | INVALID_AUTH            | Authentication/OAuth token is invalid.                                                                                                                               |\n| 400         | INVALID_AUTH_HEADER     | Authentication header is invalid.                                                                                                                                    |\n| 400         | INVALID_BATCH           | Batched request is missing or invalid.                                                                                                                               |\n| 400         | INVALID_BODY            | A request body that was not in JSON format was passed.                                                                                                               |\n| 400         | UNSUPPORTED_OPERATION   | Requested operation not supported.                                                                                                                                   |\n| 401         | ACCESS_DENIED           | Authentication unsuccessful.                                                                                                                                         |\n| 401         | NO_AUTH                 | Authentication not provided.                                                                                                                                         |\n| 403         | NOT_AUTHORIZED          | User has not been authorized to perform that action.                                                                                                                 |\n| 404         | NOT_FOUND               | Invalid URL.                                                                                                                                                         |\n| 405         | METHOD_NOT_ALLOWED      | Method is not allowed for this endpoint.                                                                                                                             |\n| 409         | REQUEST_CONFLICT        | Requested operation resulted in conflict.                                                                                                                            |\n| 429         | HIT_RATE_LIMIT          | Hourly rate limit has been reached for this token.

Make a call to any listing endpoint that retrieves a paginated response. <br> <br> \nYour format will vary, but it might look something like this: GET https://www.eventbriteapi.com/v3/categories/.\n\n2. Verify that the â€œhas_more_itemsâ€ attribute is â€œtrueâ€ before continuing. If it is â€œfalseâ€, there are no additional pages to retrieve, so you can stop here.\n\n3. Copy the continuation token from your response.\n\n4. Call the endpoint again, after adding a continuation token as a query string parameter to the URI. <br> <br> Your call format will vary, but it might look something like this: https://www.eventbriteapi.com/v3/categories/?**continuation=AEtFRyiWxkr0ZXyCJcnZ5U1-uSWXJ6vO0sxN06GbrDngaX5U5i8XYmEuZfmZZYB9Uq6bSizOLYoV**\n\n5. Repeat until all desired records have been retrieved.\n\n## Expansions\n\nEventbrite has many models that refer to each other, and often youâ€™ll want to fetch related data along with the primary\nmodel youâ€™re queryingâ€”for example, you may want to fetch an organizer along with each event you get back. The way of \ndoing this in the Eventbrite API is called \"expansions\": you can specify a set of relationships to additionally fetch \nwith every call, which reduces the number of API requests you must make to obtain your data.\n\nWhen using expansions, note that each expansion you specify will slow down your API request slightly, so try to use as\nfew expansions as possible to ensure faster response times.\n\nThe available expansions are based on the type of object that the API is returning; each of the return formats lists\navailable expansions, as you can see in the event and attendee documentation, for example.\n\n### Requesting Expansions\n\nThe Eventbrite API is currently undergoing an upgrade to its expansions system, so the ways you request an expansion \nvaries based on the API endpoint. The two sections below describe the two different request formats, but important is\ndetermining which request format an API endpoint supports.\n\nIf an endpoint's top-level response object contains an attribute named `_type`, that endpoint has been upgraded to\nExpansions v2 and also supports Expansions v1 for backwards compatibility. If the top-level response object does not\ncontain an attribute named `_type`, it has not yet been upgraded and supports <em>only</em> Expansions v1 at this time.\n\nAt some point in the future, after all endpoints have been upgraded to Expansions v2, Expansions v1 will be deprecated\nand then later removed. Eventbrite will communicate this deprecation period and removal date when the upgrade is\ncomplete and that decision has been made.\n\n#### Expansions v1\n\nIf you are already an API user, this is the expansions system with which you are likely already familiar. To request\nan expansion, pass a comma-separated list of expansion names as the `expand=` querystring argument in your URL.\n\n<em>For example, to fetch all my own events with organizers and venues expanded:</em>\n\n`/v3/users/me/owned_events/?expand=organizer,venue`\n\nSometimes you might want to expand the attributes of an object that has itself been returned by an expansion.\n\n<em>For example, you may have a list of orders and want to retrieve the event for each of those orders and the venue\nfor each of those events:</em>\n\n`/v3/users/me/orders/?expand=event.venue`\n\nExpansions can be nested in this way <b>up to four levels deep</b>.\n\n#### Expansions v2 (Recommended if Available)\n\nThis new version of expansions is similar, but keys off the `_type` attributes in the response. A response contains\neither a top-level object or a list of top-level objects. In that object or those objects, attribute values might be\nother objects or lists of objects. All objects that support expansions will contain a `_type` attribute, and within a\nlist of objects, the value of `_type` will be the same for all objects. When requesting an expansion, you pass a series\nof `expand.[value of _type]=` querystring arguments in the URL, with the value of each argument being the list of\nrequested expansions for that object type.\n\nGiven a normal, non-expanded response like this:\n\n<pre><code>{\n    \"_type\": \"event\",\n    \"name\": \"My Cool Event\",\n    \"organizer_id\": \"1234\",\n    \"venue_id\": \"5678\",\n    ...\n}\n</code></pre>\n\nYou could expand the organizer and venue with the following argument:\n\n`?expand.event=organizer,venue`\n\nWhich would result in the following change to the response:\n\n<pre><code>{\n    \"_type\": \"event\",\n    \"name\": \"My Cool Event\",\n    \"organizer_id\": \"1234\",\n    \"organizer\": {\n        \"id\": \"1234\",\n        ...\n    },\n    \"venue_id\": \"5678\",\n    \"venue\": {\n        \"id\": \"5678\",\n        ...\n    },\n    ...\n}\n</code></pre>\n\nExpansions v2 normally makes no distinction between top-level and nested expansions. Expansions belong to object types,\nnot response levels, so you can achieve \"nested\" expansions by specifying expansions for all the object types you\nexpect to receive and want to expand at any level. For example, given a normal, non-expanded response like this:\n\n<pre><code>{\n    \"_type\": \"order\",\n    \"event_id\": \"9012\",\n    ...\n}\n</code></pre>\n\nYou can expand not only the order's event, but also the event's organizer and venue, with these arguments:\n\n`?expand.order=event&expand.event=organizer,venue`\n\nAnd receive a new response like this:\n\n<pre><code>{\n    \"_type\": \"order\",\n    \"event_id\": \"9012\",\n    \"event\": {\n        \"_type\": \"event\",\n        \"name\": \"My Cool Event\",\n        \"organizer_id\": \"1234\",\n        \"organizer\": {\n            \"id\": \"1234\",\n            ...\n        },\n        \"venue_id\": \"5678\",\n        \"venue\": {\n            \"id\": \"5678\",\n            ...\n        },\n        ...\n    },\n    ...\n}\n</code></pre>\n\nHowever, this will expand all order events and all event organizers and venues, at any level, which may not be what you\nwish to achieve. If you know you want an item expanded only at a certain level, you can instead use nested expansions.\nThese arguments are equivalent to the previous example:\n\n`?expand.order=event,event.organizer,event.venue`\n\nAll of these examples are just thatâ€”examples. The exact format of a response, and its available expansions, will depend\nentirely on which API endpoint you are calling.\n\n## API Switches\n\n### What do switches do?\n\nSwitches allow for the dynamic modification of Eventbrite API endpoint behaviors. They can be used to enable new or experimental features, change response formats, and other behaviors. In general, switches are used to ease the process of phasing in new API features that would otherwise break clients. Clients may activate or deactivate switchable features by setting switch headers on API requests.\n\n### Switch lifecycle\n\nA feature and its switch go through three phases:\n\n- Opt-in, in which a new switch will be available to turn on the new feature.\n\n- Opt-out, in which the feature will be on by default and the switch will be available to turn it off.\n\n- Fully integrated, at which time the switch will be deprecated.\n\n> Eventbrite will notify all API consumers before any switchable feature is introduced or enters a new phase.\n\n### Public and protected switches\n\nSwitches may be exposed only to certain clients, at Eventbriteâ€™s discretion. Such switches will be restricted to a set of whitelisted API keys, and any client attempting to set a protected switch using a non-whitelisted API key will get a permission error.\n\nSwitches that are not protected are available to be used by any client.\n\n### Using switches\n\n#### Making a request using switch headers\n\nClients use request headers to set switches on API requests. A switch header may contain any number of switch names, separated by commas. Switch names consist of letters, numbers and underscores, and are case-insensitive.\n\nTo use the example of a switch called â€œEVENT_FORMAT_OCT_2016â€ that activates a new Event serialization format:\n\n<pre><code>GET /v3/events/12345/ Eb-Api-Switches-Enabled: EVENT_FORMAT_OCT_2016\nThis call will return the event with ID 12345 using the new format.</code></pre>\n\nIf the same switch were opt-out, and the client needed to make a request using the old Event format, it would deactivate the switch like so:\n\n<pre><code>GET /v3/events/12345/ Eb-Api-Switches-Disabled: EVENT_FORMAT_OCT_2016\nThis call would return the event using the old format.</code></pre>\n\n### Errors\n\nA request containing switch headers may return the following error codes:\n\n**409 REQUEST_CONFLICT:** Conflicting switches were passed. This happens if the client passes the same switch in both the Enabled and Disabled headers.\n**403 NOT_AUTHORIZED:** The client sent a header for a switch that it is not allowed to set.\n**400 BAD_REQUEST:** The client sent a header for a switch that does not exist or has been deprecated.\n\n## Basic Types\n\n### Integer\n\n`10`\n\nA standard JSON integer.\n\n### Boolean\n\n`true`\n\nA standard JSON boolean.\n\n### String\n\n`\"Ihre Aal ist r\\u00fcckw\\u00e4rts\"`\n\nA standard JSON string.\n\n(When POSTing data as `application/x-www-form-urlencoded`, use a UTF-8\nencoded string instead rather than unicode escapes)\n\n### Float\n\n`72.19381730`\n\nA standard JSON floating-point decimal.\n\n### Decimal\n\n`\"72.19381730\"`\n\nAn arbitrary-precision decimal number encoded as a standard JSON string. Decimals are used in cases where\nfloating-point arithmetic inaccuracies could arise with standard JSON floating-point decimals.\n\n### Date Types\n\nThere are four types of date formats:\n\n* Date\n\n* Datetime\n\n* Local Datetime\n\n* Datetime with Timezone\n\n#### Date\n\n`\"2010-01-31\"`\n\nDate represents a date as a string in ISO8601 date format. If you wish to represent a time as well, you'll need to use Datetime, Local Datetime, or Datetime with Timezone.\n\n#### Datetime\n\n`\"2010-01-31T13:00:00Z\"`\n\nDatetime represents a date and time as a string in ISO8601 combined date and time format in UTC (Coordinated Universal Time).\n\n#### Local Datetime\n\n`\"2010-01-31T13:00:00\"`\n\nLocal Datetime represents a date and time as a string in Naive Local ISO8601 date and time format in the timezone of the event.\n\n#### Datetime with Timezone\n\nThis value is only used for fields where the timezone itself is important information (for example, event start times).\n\n<pre><code>{\n    \"timezone\": \"America/Los_Angeles\",\n    \"utc\": \"2018-05-12T02:00:00Z\",\n    \"local\": \"2018-05-11T19:00:00\"\n}\n</code></pre>\n\n| Value                                  | Type       | Description                                   |\n| :------------------------------------- | :--------  | :-------------------------------------------- |\n| `\"timezone\": \"America/Los_Angeles\"`    | `string`   | A timezone value from the Olson specification |\n| `\"utc\": \"2018-05-12T02:00:00Z\"`        | `datetime` | A datetime value in the UTC timezone          |\n| `\"local\": \"2018-05-11T19:00:00`        | `datetime` | A datetime value in the named timezone        |\n\nWhen being sent as a request:\n\n* `utc` and `timezone` are required\n\n* `local` is ignored\n\n### List\n\n<pre><code>[1, 2, 3, 4]\n\"1,2,3,4\"\n</code></pre>\n\nA list of literal values. With a content-type of `application/json`, it\nshould be a JSON array of literals, otherwise, for\n`application/x-www-form-urlencoded` it should be a string than is a comma\nseparated list of values.\n\n### Object List\n\n<pre><code>[{\"name1\": \"val1\", \"name2\": \"val2\"}, {...}]\n\"[{\\\"name1\\\": \\\"val1\\\", \\\"name2\\\": \\\"val2\\\"}, {...}]\"\n</code></pre>\n\nA JSON list of object values. With a content-type of `application/json`, it\nshould be a JSON array, otherwise, for `application/x-www-form-urlencoded`\nit should be a string encoding of a JSON array.\n\n### Dictionary\n\n<pre><code>{\"key1\": \"value1\", \"key2\": {\"objectkey\": \"value\"}, \"key3\": [list_values], {...}}\n\"{\\\"key2\\\": {\\\"key3\\\": \\\"value\\\"}, \\\"key1\\\": \\\"value\\\", \\\"key4\\\": [\\\"value\\\", \\\"value\\\"]}\"\n</code></pre>\n\nA JSON object representation of a dictionary. With a content-type of\n`application/json`, it should be a JSON object, otherwise, for\n`application/x-www-form-urlencoded` it should be a string encoding\nof a JSON object.\n\n### Multipart Text\n\n<pre><code>{\n    \"text\": \"Event Name\",\n    \"html\": \"<b>Event</b> Name\",\n}\n</code></pre>\n\nReturned for fields which represent HTML, like event names\nand descriptions.\n\nThe `html` key represents the original HTML (which _should_\nbe sanitized and free from injected script tags etc., but as always, be careful\nwhat you put in your DOM), while the `text` key is a stripped version useful\nfor places where you can't or don't need to display the full HTML version.\n\n### Country Code\n\n`\"AR\"`\n\nThe ISO 3166 alpha-2 code of a country.\n\n### Currency Code\n\n`\"USD\"`\n\nAn ISO 4217 3-character code of a currency\n\n### Currency\n\n<pre><code>{\n    \"currency\": \"USD\",\n    \"value\": 432,\n    \"major_value\": \"4.32\",\n    \"display\": \"4.32 USD\"\n}\n</code></pre>\n\nWhen submitting as form-encoded POST data, you can instead provide a string\nindicating the currency and the value separated by a comma, e.g. `USD,432` -\nhowever, when you submit a JSON POST body, you must submit this as a JSON\nobject with the `currency` and `value` fields.\n\nReturned for monetary values, such as ticket prices, fees charged and\ntax amounts.\n\nCurrencies are represented as their currency code and an integer value,\nwhere the code is the currency code as defined by\n`ISO 4217 <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_4217>`\\_ and the integer value\nis the number of units of the minor unit of the currency (e.g. cents for\nUS dollars).\n\nYou can get a value in the currency's major unit - for example, dollars\nor pound sterling - by taking the integer value provided and shifting the\ndecimal point left by the exponent value for that currency as defined in\n`ISO 4217 <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_4217>`\\_.\n\nFor example, the exponent for USD (the US dollar) is 2, so a value of\n`2311` becomes `$23.11`. For JPY (the Japanese yen) it's 0, so\na value of `2311` becomes `Â¥2311`.\n\nEventbrite does not currently sell tickets in non-decimal currencies,\nsuch as the Malagasy ariary (MGA), but any value for them would also be\nreturned in minor units (for example, `(\"MGA\", 7)` would mean 1.2 MGA,\nor 1 ariary and 2 francs).\n\nThe `display` value is provided for your convenience; its formatting\nmay change depending on the locale you query the API with (for example,\ncommas for decimal separators in European locales).\n\n### Address\n\n<pre><code>{\n    \"address_1\": \"333 O'Farrell St\",\n    \"address_2\": \"Suite 400\",\n    \"city\": \"San Francisco\",\n    \"region\": \"CA\",\n    \"postal_code\": \"94102\",\n    \"country\": \"US\",\n    \"latitude\": \"37.7576792\",\n    \"longitude\": \"-122.5078119\",\n    \"localized_address_display\": \"333 O'Farrell St Suite 400, San Francisco, CA 94102\",\n    \"localized_area_display\": \"San Francisco, CA\",\n    \"localized_multi_line_address_display\": [\"333 O'Farrell St\", \"Suite 400\", \"San Francisco, CA 94102\"]\n}\n</code></pre>\n\nThough address formatting varies considerably between different countries and\nregions, Eventbrite still has a common address return format to keep things\nconsistent.\n\nIn general, you should treat `address_1`, `address_2`, `city`, and\n`region` as opaque lines of the address printed in that order. The\n`postal_code` field contains the local postal or zip code equivalent, if\navailable, and the `country` field contains the `ISO 3166 <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_3166-1>`\\_\ncountry code for the country (with the name of the country broken out\nfor your convenience).\n\nAll fields apart from `address_1` and `country` are optional.\n\n#### Address Fields\n\n| Field                                  | Type      | Description                                                                                                                 |\n| :------------------------------------- | :-------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |\n| `address_1`                            | `string`  | The street/location address (part 1)                                                                                        |\n| `address_2`                            | `string`  | The street/location address (part 2)                                                                                        |\n| `city`                                 | `string`  | The city                                                                                                                    |\n| `region`                               | `string`  | The ISO 3166-2 2- or 3-character region code for the state, province, region, or district                                   |\n| `postal_code`                          | `string`  | The postal code                                                                                                             |\n| `country`                              | `string`  | The ISO 3166-1 2-character international code for the country                                                               |\n| `latitude`                             | `decimal` | The latitude portion of the address coordinates                                                                             |\n| `longitude`                            | `decimal` | The longitude portion of the address coordinates                                                                            |\n| `localized_address_display`            | `string`  | The format of the address display localized to the address country                                                          |\n| `localized_area_display`               | `string`  | The format of the address's area display localized to the address country                                                   |\n| `localized_multi_line_address_display` | `list`    | The multi-line format order of the address display localized to the address country, where each line is an item in the list |\n\n### Object\n\n<pre><code>{\n    \"resource_uri\": \"https://www.eventbriteapi.com/v3/events/3564383166/\",\n    \"id\": \"3564383166\",\n}\n</code></pre>\n\nThe standard base representation for first-class objects in Eventbrite, such\nas :format:`event`, :format:`venue` and :format:`order`.\n\nThe `resource_uri` is an absolute URL to the API endpoint that will return\nyou the canonical representation of the event, and the `id` is a\n:format:`string` that represents a unique identifer for the event (note\nthat it is not necessarily numeric).\n\nOther fields on objects are defined on their individual pages, but note that\nfields may not be present if their value is `null`; we have noted fields\nthat may not contain a value with `(optional)`.\n\n## Eventual Consistency\n\nThe Eventbrite Platform is large and, as such, contains a great amount of data. In order to provide the fastest\nexperience practicable to its users, the Platform employs a model known as\n[eventual consistency](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eventual_consistency). In short, new or updated data may not be\navailable instantly after you submit changes.\n\n### Implications of Eventual Consistency\n\nThere are many implications associated with the use of eventual consistencyâ€”some of them positive, some of them\nunfortunate. The key positive to eventual consistency is that it makes the Platform faster and generally provides a\nbetter, more reliable, and more available experience for users and partners alike. The notable downside is that when\nyou or someone else creates a new event, modifies an existing event, updates the profile for a venue, or otherwise\nmodifies data on the Platform, those changes may not be immediately visible.\n\nWhen you submit a `POST` or `DELETE` request to alter data, the response you receive, if successful, will always contain\nthe most-up-to-date data, reflecting your changes immediately. However, if you then instantly submit a `GET` request to\nobtain that same data, you may get a `404 Not Found` response (if it's new data you created), or the response may\ncontain stale data (if it's existing data you updated). The time between when you submit your changes and when those\nchanges are visible across the Platform can vary from as little as 1 second to as much as 5 minutes, depending on the\ndata and the current amount of traffic the Platform is handling. In almost all circumstances, that time is less than\n15 seconds.\n\n### Use Waypoints for Immediate Consistency\n\nThere are times where eventual consistency makes it difficult to use the API for rapidly making changes. For example,\ncreating an event, adding ticket classes to that event, and updating images for that event, all with a set of API calls\nthat occur over the series of several seconds. Eventbrite Waypoints allow Platform developers to request immediate\nconsistency during such activities.\n\nA Waypoint is a sort of bookmark to tell the Platform when in the data timeline you expect your data to be found. When\nyou submit a `POST` or `DELETE` request to alter data, the response you receive, if successful, will contain an\nHTTP header named `Eventbrite-API-Waypoint-Token`. The value of this header is the Waypoint for the data you just\ncreated or altered. It is encrypted, but its contents are not important. On the very next response, include a request\nheader named `Eventbrite-API-Waypoint-Token` with the exact, unaltered value copied from the previous response header.\nYou should do this even if your next request is a `GET` or another `POST` or `DELETE`. In this way, its use is very\nsimilar to a browser cookie.\n\nContinue to do this for subsequent responses and requests. Each time you receive a response containing the header\n`Eventbrite-API-Waypoint-Token`, submit your next request with the header value from that most-recent response. This\nwill avoid errors commonly associated with eventual consistency, such as `404 Not Found`. There is a downside, however:\nsubmitting these tokens in your requests will slow down the requests by as much as 5 extra seconds on top of the\nnormal request time for a given endpoint (though usually less than 1 second).\n\nYou do not have to hold on to Waypoint tokens indefinitely, and you do not even have to use Waypoint tokens. Once about\n5 minutes has passed since your last request, you can discard any Waypoint token you received in that response, and\nsubmit your next request with no Waypoint token header. Also, if eventual consistency does not pose any concerns to\nyour workflow, you can safely ignore Waypoint tokens entirely.",

Access codes can also optionally contain a discount amount.\n\n+ **Hold Discount.** Allows Order owner to apply or unlock Discount for seats on hold.\n\nThe display price of a ticket is calculated as: \\\n`price_before_discount` - `discount_amount` = `display_price`\n\nNotes:\n\n* Public and Coded Discounts can specify either an amount off or a percentage off, but not both types discounts.\n\n* Public Discounts should not contain apostrophes or non-alphanumeric characters (except â€œ-â€, â€œ_â€, â€ â€, â€œ(â€, â€)â€, â€œ/â€, and â€œâ€).\n\n* Coded Discounts and Access Codes should not contain spaces, apostrophes or non-alphanumeric characters (except â€œ-â€, â€œ_â€, â€œ(â€, â€)â€, â€œ/â€, and â€œâ€).\n\n#### Fields\n\nUse these fields to specify information about a Discount.\n\n|         Field         |       Type       |                                                                                              Description                                                                                              |\n| :-------------------- | :--------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |\n| `code`                | `string`         | Discount name for a Public Discount, or the code for a Coded Discount and Access Code.                                                                                                                |\n| `type`                | `string`         | Discount type.

      "description": "<a name=\"ticket_class_object\"></a>\n\n## Ticket Class Object\n\nThe Ticket Class object represents a possible ticket class (i.e. ticket type) for an [Event](#event_object).\n\nTypically, multiple different types of tickets for an Event can be purchased in one transaction. These ticket types do not necessarily map directly to the one [Attendee](#attendee_object) per one ticket model (instead for example, an Attendee might buy multiple tickets for different days of an [Event Series](#event_series_object)).\n\nTicket Classes can be one of the following types:\n\n* **Free.** Ticket Classes that have no cost or currency. An Event with only free Ticket Classes is a free Event and doesn't require payout information.\n\n* **Paid.** Ticket Classes with an associated cost in the Event's currency. Currency is specified in the Event object and is duplicated in the Ticket Class object as the return value of a `currency type`.\n\n* **Donation.** Order owner is prompted to enter at their own discretion an amount to donate during checkout. There is no fixed cost of donation.\n\nTicket Class price can be communicated in a way that either includes Eventbrite fees in the total displayed price or shows fees split out as a separate cost from the total ticket price. The [User](#user_object) determines how costs are communicated.\n\nTicket Class responses for Events not owned by the [Organization](#organization_object) only shows cost and fees, as displayed on the Ticket Listing page. Results from Events the Organization owns also includes information on the `actual_cost` and `actual_fee`, which identify the amount of the ticket that the Organization is paid (actual_cost) and the Eventbrite fee deducted from the total charged amount (actual_fee).\n\nTicket Classes can be grouped using the [Ticket Group](#ticket_group_object) object, most commonly to apply a [Cross-Event Discount](#discount_object) to multiple Ticket Classes.\n\n#### Public Fields\n\nUse these fields to specify information about a Ticket Class. For publically listed Events, this Ticket Class information can be viewed by all [Users](#user_object) and Eventbrite applications.\n\n|       Field        |    Type    |                                                          Description                                                                                  |\n| :----------------- | :--------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| `name`             | `string`   | Ticket Class name.                                                                                                                                    |\n| `description`      | `string`   | (Optional) Ticket Class description.                                                                                                                  |\n| `sorting`          | `integer`  | The order in which ticket classes are listed during purchase flow on the event listing page.                                                          |\n| `cost`             | `currency` | Display cost of the Ticket Class (paid only) on Ticket Listing page.                                                                                  |\n| `fee`              | `currency` | Display fee of the Ticket Class (paid only) on Ticket Listing page.                                                                                   |\n| `donation`         | `boolean`  | true = Ticket Class is a Donation.                                                                                                                    |\n| `free`             | `boolean`  | true = Ticket Class is Free.                                                                                                                          |\n| `minimum_quantity` | `integer`  | Minimum number of tickets that can be purchased per [Order](#order_object).                                                                           |\n| `maximum_quantity` | `integer`  | Maximum number of tickets that can be purchased per Order.                                                                                            |\n| `has_pdf_ticket`   | `boolean`  | true = Attendee receives a PDF Order confirmation.                                                                                                    |\n| `delivery_methods` | `list`     | List of delivery methods enabled for this Ticket Class.
